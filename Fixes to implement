Title: EcoLens App - Tab Switching Issue When Editing Observations

Context: I have a complete HTML/JavaScript/CSS EcoLens field observation application with three tabs: Record, Logbook, and Export. When clicking "Edit" on an observation in the Logbook tab, the form should populate with data AND switch to the Record tab visually. Currently, the form populates correctly but the tab doesn't switch visually.

Problem Details:

1. Current Behavior: Clicking "Edit" → data loads into Record form but tab stays on Logbook visually
2. Expected Behavior: Clicking "Edit" → should switch to Record tab visually AND load data
3. Files: Single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript (all in one file)
4. Key Methods: editObservation(id) and switchTab(tabName)
5. Tab Structure:
   · Tab buttons: .tab-btn with data-tab attribute
   · Tab panels: .tab-panel with IDs like record-panel, logbook-panel, export-panel
   · Active state: .active class on both button and panel

What I've Tried:

1. Called this.switchTab('record') in editObservation() - app became unresponsive
2. Manually set classes/display properties - inconsistent results
3. Checked CSS transitions/animations - might be interfering

CSS Concern: The tab panels use display: none → display: block with animations, which might be preventing proper switching.

Request: Please analyze my complete inline code below and provide:

1. Exact replacement for the editObservation() method
2. Minimal CSS adjustments for reliable tab switching
3. Working solution that maintains existing animations where possible
4. Explanation of what was wrong and why the fix works

Complete Code: [Paste your entire HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript here]

Additional Info: The app uses vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks), localStorage for data, and Leaflet for maps. Please provide code snippets that I can directly replace in my existing file.
